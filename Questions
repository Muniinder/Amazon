Why Amazon? 
    I find Amazon to be the most customer centric company of this planet. I mean it. I have been a customer for ages and 
    have always wondered how efficient and scalable your hardware and software systems are. I am sure it will be a huge 
    learning opportunity for me to be part of Amazon. I will actually be proud to contribute to its growth.
    
Why are you keen to join us?
    
    
Tell us about our product categories.

Explain the 4 basics of OOP.
    POLYMORPHISM
    ENCAPSULATION
    DATA ABSTRACTION
    INHERITANCE
Define data abstraction and its importance.
    Data Abstraction means hiding the implemetation part and show whts necessary, for e.g. like we have a dvd player, internally 
    there are lot of chips, etc is present, but outside they have shown just a few buttons to operate, means hiding the complexity 
    or internal implementation and show whats necessary to operate.
    Its important because we can change our implementation part without letting know the user and also for the purpose of secuirity
    we hide the implementation part so that no one knows from outside how we did that.
    
Prepare an object-oriented model design (for an elevator, parking lot or movie theatre).

Explain polymorphism.
    Poly means many and morph means forms, we usually use this to reduce redundancy in our code.for 
    e.g In python it can be achived as in function overriding.
    
Find 10 of Amazonâ€™s top-selling products.
    If i have access to amazon database, it would be still quite time consuminng task as it has a lot of data.
    But i will make a max heap upto 10 elements and iterate over all the items.
    
What are the time and space complexity differences over iterating between arrays, hashes, binary trees, etc?
    
Code client-side javascript.
How would you find all HTML elements on a page by class?
