Why Amazon? 
    I find Amazon to be the most customer centric company of this planet. I mean it. I have been a customer for ages and 
    have always wondered how efficient and scalable your hardware and software systems are. I am sure it will be a huge 
    learning opportunity for me to be part of Amazon. I will actually be proud to contribute to its growth.

Question1: Introduce yourself/ Tell me about yourself.
Ans :   My name is Muninder Jeet Singh,i pursued my bachelors in Chemical Engg at National Institute of Technology,Jalandhar .

        songs in fingerstyle guitar and gives lessons of that too.
        Apart from that, i love doing work of a software engineer, i had made my own portfolio. from past 1.5 years i have been 
        fascinated with the software industry so much, i can chat about compter science projects all day long.
        I have also been fasinated with machine learning and deep learning that i started upskilling myself in that area.
        i had also 0.5 months experience in it industry, i have worked on e-book library project, sap abap project which i love to work
        I beleieve with Software engineering we have the power to do anything
        
Question2: Can you tell me about any scenario where you have taken an initiative in your previous jobs to do something/solve something 
           that was not strictly required of you.   
    Sit.    : In SAP project we have given srs document to make custom screens using abap module pool programs, 
    Task    : I  think about about the customer point of view how they will gonna use this, so basically we thought of as they 
              have to always open sap and perform the transaction code, why not they'll also able to open on another computer
              which has no sap software but can access to sap
    Action  : So i made a single click web page interface that connects with sap which performs to view the details of a particular 
              order or to make an order using web dynpro component.
    Result  : The new functionality added
    

IF YOU ARE GIVEN OPEN ENDED QUESTION, ALWAYS THINK ABOUT CUSTOMER POINT OF VIEW.

CUSTOMER OBSESSION: Walk us through a time when you helped a customer through a difficult process and what that looked like.

              which has no sap software but can access to sap

INVENT AND SIMPLIFY: Tell me a time when you created an innovative product.
    Resume Portal
    Sit.    : Its our 3rd year in college and companies started to came in our college, Placement representatives from our classes were
              struggled to collect resumes of all the students because sometimes students send wrong resume, or some people forget to
              send resume, kind of these problems
    Task    : we have to think about how this process removes redundancy so that Placement reperesentatives get focus on getting 
              companies rather than just struggling with collecting ids only
    Action  : i along with my friends came up with the solution, to create an online portal where student can login and can upload
              there resume and other information (if required) because different companies need different information and the 
              placement representative can collect resumes in his google drive id with a single click.

    I chose to become a software engineer, because i love to do the work and when the product is created it feels good how with just 
    programming we can cut out redundant task easily. 
    
    Sit.    : I was amazed by ml and deep learning in the field of healthcare, amazon go, its really fascinating that how we can 
              show data into mathematical models and work on to predict real case scenarios
    Task    : so i just started learning ml and deep learning
    Action  : that motivated me to learn and work more in these fields and today i feel that with deep learning and ml we can create
              anything, we just need data, thats all

Explain the 4 basics of OOP.
    POLYMORPHISM
    ENCAPSULATION
    DATA ABSTRACTION
    INHERITANCE
Define data abstraction and its importance.
    Data Abstraction means hiding the implemetation part and show whts necessary, for e.g. like we have a dvd player, internally 
    there are lot of chips, etc is present, but outside they have shown just a few buttons to operate, means hiding the complexity 
    or internal implementation and show whats necessary to operate.
    Its important because we can change our implementation part without letting know the user and also for the purpose of secuirity
    we hide the implementation part so that no one knows from outside how we did that.
    
Prepare an object-oriented model design (for an elevator, parking lot or movie theatre).

Explain polymorphism.
    Poly means many and morph means forms, we usually use this to reduce redundancy in our code.for 
    e.g In python it can be achived as in function overriding.
    
Find 10 of Amazonâ€™s top-selling products.
    If i have access to amazon database, it would be still quite time consuminng task as it has a lot of data.
    But i will make a max heap upto 10 elements and iterate over all the items.
    
What are the time and space complexity differences over iterating between arrays, hashes, binary trees, etc?
