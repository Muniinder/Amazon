SOLID PRINCIPLES : https://medium.com/mindorks/solid-principles-explained-with-examples-79d1ce114ace


STEPS:
  1.  Handling Ambiguity: ask clarifying question, 
      - do you want me to come up with the system design
      - do you want me to write class hierarchy
      - or just certain function or methods 
  2.  Systematic Approach
      - approach and try to find what more data you need
      - ask question about the type of data, how much data etc.
  3.  Make a image in your mind how this particular design gonna look like 
      ( e.g. parking lot : it can be designed for multiple buildings, multiple levels, have different size of spots)
