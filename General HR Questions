  Greetings
  I am Muninder. I had completed my bachelors in checmical engg from NIT Jalandhar.
  I love to play basketball. I also like to play guitar. I also having a you tube channel with the name
  singh plays strings which is having more than 50,000 views right now.
  
  In my final year I have conciously decided to become a software developement engineer. (Why?)
  Because I love to write code. Also because my friend circle was from Computer science stream, me and my friends were talk 
  about how to create things with programming. The decision point was when I get to know that my friend had made a custom NLP system 
  and when i thought we can do this as well wtih programming i was amazed and decided this is what i want to be.
  
  So i joined an IT company which also gives training on joining. and after completing my training i was allocated 
  to the project for a us client.
  
  
Why Amazon ?
  
  From my past experiences, I have learned that if you want to be best you have to learn from the best. Amazon is not
  only the giant in tech but its success rooted in customer obsession.
  I want to be a great software engineer someday and amazon will gives me the right platform not only to learn only tech but
  customer satisfaction as well as it is the most customer centric company of the world.
