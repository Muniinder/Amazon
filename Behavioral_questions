Q.  Tell me about a time when you were faced with a problem that had a number of possible solutions.What was the problem and how did 
    you determine the course of action? What was the outcome of that choice?
Ans- related to me: It was my final year in college and i was still struggling what to do next. I did my majors in chemical Engineering
     with minors in software engineering course. I have number of solutions to opt for like go for masters, or mba or go for a job or to 
     go to abroad and settle. Above all choices i decide i want to becomoe Software Engineer because when i look back i always been fascinated with
     Software engineering, like i can talk all day with my cse friends about cs topics, projects and i realise this is what i want to do
     Even today i feel that was the best decision of my life. Because i am happy doing this

Q. When did you take a risk, make a mistake, or fail? How did you respond, and how did you grow from that experience?
Ans-   S :  We were doing a project in sap, where we have to work on tablescript and tabscrpit which is an inbuilt functionality, but we are making 
            are making a customised screen as given in SRS document
       T:   It was like a view having a various functionality to place an order, to make quotation, etc and whenever a user fill the 
            table it make a contact with database to know the availablity, its price , specifications and all. as general if you 
            make this in other techmology its not a big deal but when you make it in a sap,a lot of internal modules get 
            triggered So this was the situation after filling up the details about any product and press Enter, it go and 
            performs a four modules, and they were handling the integrated core sap functions, and we were still struggling 
            to do that task, and that when we commit a mistake. 
           
           
           


Q-  Describe a time you took the lead on a project.
Ans- Till now i have done 2 projects only.

Q-  What did you do when you needed to motivate a group of individuals or promote collaboration on a particular project?
Ans This happened to me during SAP project, we were group of 4 people from 4 different state, we just do work and some formal talk and
    then leave for the day. I realised that we should know each other more as this will increase thier involvement and performance 
    and they will happily come to do their work and leave at the end of the day, so twice in a day i just try to learn more about them
    and always try to start conversation which involves everyone. And with in a week i realised we are moving forward rapidly
 
Q:  How have you leveraged data to develop a strategy?
Ans I realised the power of data little late, but eventually i do.
    I want to mention that apart from my job i also have my own you tube channel where i play some famous somgs of Indian and some
    hollywood songs in fingerstyle guitar and giving a lesson for my covers also.
    I take decision about which song should i cover next, based on available data like searching volume, how popular song is,
    experimenting on searching.
    in addition to do that , i also used google analytics where i store my audience data 
    
    
    apart from that when i realised the value of data, i used to store the value of my money spendings like how much did i spent on
    eatings, on myself, on vehicle petrol and all these types of things and see which thing should i do it in more efficient and
    with less money.
    So for e.g. i noticed that i spend a lot of money on unnecessary things, 
    i categorise things and take an action according to the need only.
